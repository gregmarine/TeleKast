<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1. Application of License.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an additional document offering the additional rights described in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 3.5.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; months after the date it initially became available, or at least six<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Third Party Claims.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Contributor APIs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Representations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.5. Required Notices.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to look for such a notice.&nbsp; If You created one or more Modification(s)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit A.&nbsp; You must also duplicate this License in any documentation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rights relating to Covered Code.&nbsp; You may choose to offer, and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms You offer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.7. Larger Works.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Application of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br>
<br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1. New Versions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be given a distinguishing version number.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Covered Code created under this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.3. Derivative Works.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; license (except to note that your license differs from this License)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this License.)<br>
<br>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
8. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.1.&nbsp; This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall survive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.2.&nbsp; If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You file such action is referred to as "Participant")&nbsp; alleging that:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Contributor Version against such Participant.&nbsp; If within 60 days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the 60 day notice period specified above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participant.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.3.&nbsp; If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; license.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.4.&nbsp; In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>
<br>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br>

<br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.<br>
<br>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br>
<br>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Multiple-Licensed".&nbsp; "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br>
