<br>




You can look at TeleKast in two ways. First of all, it is a script
editor. The scripts you create can be used for feature stories,
interviews and, of course, for the teleprompter. The teleprompter is
the second way you can look at TeleKast. In short, you don't have to
memorize your lines. You simply read what the teleprompter says and you
will look like a pro.<br>




<br>




It is the hope of the TeleKast community that you will enjoy using this
software. Please provide feedback as you use it and TeleKast will
continue to become a better application to meet your needs.<br>







<br>
Note: This software
is in an alpha state. The largest effort is going toward finding and
fixing
bugs. New features will not be added to the 1.0.0.* series of releases.
We hope to be in a beta state very soon. And soon after that, a
production quality version will be released.
