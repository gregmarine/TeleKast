TeleKast is your means for creative communication. It is an application
you can use for your school, church or any organization which needs features
like a Teleprompter, Web document creation (from a script) and Kiosk slide
show (also from a script). Basically, you first create a script and then you
can use it for just about anything. Broadcast journalism, whether in a school
or professional television studio, can benefit from the built in teleprompter.
You can use the Web document editor to put your news online. The Kiosk is great
for slide shows on television, standalone kiosk stations or announcements
projected on a screen. Finally, the scripts could be used for purposes such as
interviews, feature stories or someone reading when standing in front of a
crowd. Again, TeleKast is your means for creative communication.

TeleKast is also open source software. It has been released as open source
software protected by a dual license. The Mozilla Public License version 1.1 and
the GNU General Public License version 2.0. These licenses should have been
included with this version of TeleKast. If you did not receive these licenses,

Note: This is alpha software. So, the application and the Web site are not
complete. However, you may download, use and/or modify the software in its current
state. TeleKast is built on the Mozilla Platform. So, it makes heavy use of
Mozilla's XML User Interface Language (XUL) and JavaScript. The source code does
not need to be compiled. So, you can run TeleKast straight from source if you
obtain XUL Runner from Mozilla's Web site (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner).
You can look at and/or modify the source from the source downloads. They are separated
by operating system because the downloads are compressed using the common method for
each OS and the icon format is different for each. (.zip/.ico for Windows and .tar.gz/.xpm
for Linux). Mac is now supported.
